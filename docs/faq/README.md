# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Why is the Magazine stat on X weapon slightly off?</summary>
  
  The Magazine stat we get from Bungie's API has a documented history of being inaccurate to what's in game. We do our best to account for these discrepancies, but expect the numbers to occasionally be a bit off.

  <summary>Why is X new perk info not showing correctly/infomation incorrect?</summary>

  Whenever a new perk is added, it takes time for us to properly implement it. Some perks are easier than others, but they all require some amount of time to be added. In addition, some time may be required to test the perk to get accurate values as well. We appreciate your patience!

  If an older perk is having issues please feel free to look in the support channel in our discord, and if needed, open a new thread.
